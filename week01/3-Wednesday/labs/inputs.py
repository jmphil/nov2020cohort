# Please enter your name: Eric
# Hello, Eric!

first_name = input("What is your name?")

print("Hello {}".format(first_name))





# Prompt the user for his name using the input function. Example:


# Same as the first exercise, but this time print the user's
# name in ALL CAPS, and also tell them the number of letters in their name.

first_name = input("What is your name?")

print("Hello {}".format(first_name))

# (Hint: You'll want to search for documentation on how to uppercase a string.)
